msgid "We try not to reinvent the wheel, but to bring something innovative to the market. As a consequence, we're focused on our own code and use pre-existing, high quality third-party libraries where possible. To support the full, rich set of features that Kivy offers, several other libraries are required. If you do not use a specific feature (e.g. video playback), you don't need the corresponding dependency. That said, there is one dependency that Kivy **does** require: `Cython <http://cython.org>`_."

If you want to enable features like windowing (i.e. open a Window), audio/video playback or spelling correction, additional dependencies must be available. For these, we recommend `SDL2 <https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php>`_, `Gstreamer 1.x <http://www.gstreamer.net/>`_ and `PyEnchant <https://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/>`_, respectively."

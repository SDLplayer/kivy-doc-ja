msgid "This example changes texture properties and the properties of its containing rectangle. You should see some a multicolored texture with sliders to the left and below and buttons at the bottom of the screen. The image :ref:`texture_example_image.png <canvas_texture_example_image.png>` is rendered into the rectangle. Sliders change the number of copies of the texture (the tex_coords), the size of enclosing rectangle (the taw_height and taw_width) while the buttons change how the texture is rendered when more than one copy is in the rectangle (the texture_wrap)."

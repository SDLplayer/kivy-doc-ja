"Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the "
"physical density of the screen. With a :attr:`~MetricsBase.density` of 1,"
" 1dp is equal to 1px. When running on a higher density screen, the number"
" of pixels used to draw 1dp is scaled up a factor appropriate to the "
"screen's dpi, and the inverse for a lower dpi. The ratio of dp-to-pixels "
"will change with the screen density, but not necessarily in direct "
"proportion. Using the dp unit is a simple solution to making the view "
"dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen densities."
" In others words, it provides consistency for the real-world size of your"
" UI across different devices."

"Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also "
"scaled by the user's font size preference. We recommend you use this unit"
" when specifying font sizes, so the font size will be adjusted to both "
"the screen density and the user's preference."

"Depending on your Video core provider, platform, and plugins, you will be"
" able to play different formats. For example, the pygame video provider "
"only supports MPEG1 on Linux and OSX. GStreamer is more versatile, and "
"can read many video containers and codecs such as MKV, OGV, AVI, MOV, FLV"
" (if the correct gstreamer plugins are installed). Our "
":class:`~kivy.core.video.VideoBase` implementation is used under the "

"An adapter is a mediating controller-type class that processes and "
"presents data for use in views. It does this by generating models, "
"generally lists of :class:`~kivy.uix.selectableview.SelectableView` "
"items, that are consumed and presented by views. Views are top-level "
"widgets, such as a :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView`, that allow users"
" to scroll through and (optionally) interact with your data."

"Kivy adapters are modelled on the `Adapter design pattern "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern>`_. Conceptually, they play"
" the role of a 'controller' between you data and views in a `Model-View-"
"Controller "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ "

"**Adapters**: The adapter plays a mediating role between the user "
"interface and your data. It manages the creation of the view elements for"
" the model using the args_converter to prepare the contructor arguments "
"for your cls/template view items."

"The base :class:`Adapter` is subclassed by the :class:`SimpleListAdapter`"

"**Models**: The data for which an adapter serves as a bridge to views can"
" be any sort of data. However, for convenience, model mixin classes can "
"ease the preparation or shaping of data for use in the system. For "
"selection operations, the :class:`SelectableDataItem` can optionally "
"prepare data items to provide and receive selection information (data "
"items are not required to be \"selection-aware\", but in some cases it "
"may be desired)."

"**Args Converters**: Argument converters are made by the application "

"row of your data and create dictionaries that are passed into the "
"constructors of your cls/template which are then used populate your View."

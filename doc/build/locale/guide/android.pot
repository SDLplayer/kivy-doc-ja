msgid "You can run Kivy applications on Android, on (more or less) any device with OpenGL ES 2.0 (Android 2.2 minimum). This is standard on modern devices; Google reports the requirement is met by `99.9% of devices <https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html>`_."

#: ../../sources/guide/android.rst:86
msgid "`Plyer <https://github.com/kivy/plyer>`__ is a pythonic, platform-independent API to use features commonly found on various platforms, particularly mobile ones. The idea is that your app can call simply call a Plyer function, such as to present a notification to the user, and Plyer will take care of doing so in the right way regardless of the platform or operating system. Internally, Plyer uses Pyjnius (on Android), Pyobjus (on iOS) and some platform specific APIs on desktop platforms."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/android.rst:142
msgid "This code directly follows the java API functions to call the vibrator, with Pyjnius automatically translating the api to Python code and our calls back to the equivalent java. It is much more verbose and java-like than Plyer's version, for no benefit in this case, though Plyer does not wrap every API available to Pyjnius."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/android.rst:148

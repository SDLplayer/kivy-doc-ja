msgid "Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. With a :attr:`~MetricsBase.density` of 1, 1dp is equal to 1px. When running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw 1dp is scaled up a factor appropriate to the screen's dpi, and the inverse for a lower dpi. The ratio of dp-to-pixels will change with the screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using the dp unit is a simple solution to making the view dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen densities. In others words, it provides consistency for the real-world size of your UI across different devices."

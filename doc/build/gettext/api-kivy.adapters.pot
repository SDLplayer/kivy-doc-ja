msgid "An adapter is a mediating controller-type class that processes and presents data for use in views. It does this by generating models, generally lists of :class:`~kivy.uix.selectableview.SelectableView` items, that are consumed and presented by views. Views are top-level widgets, such as a :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView`, that allow users to scroll through and (optionally) interact with your data."

msgid "Kivy adapters are modelled on the `Adapter design pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern>`_. Conceptually, they play the role of a 'controller' between you data and views in a `Model-View-Controller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ type architecture."

However, for convenience, model mixin classes can ease the preparation or shaping of data for use in the system. For selection operations, the :class:`SelectableDataItem` can optionally prepare data items to provide and receive selection information (data items are not required to be \"selection-aware\", but in some cases it may be desired)."

In effect, they take each row of your data and create dictionaries that are passed into the constructors of your cls/template which are then used populate your View."

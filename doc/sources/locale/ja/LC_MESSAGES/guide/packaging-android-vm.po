msgid "Currently, Kivy Android applications can only be built in a Linux environment configured with python-for-android, the Android SDK and the Android NDK. As this environment in not only tricky to setup but also impossible on Windows or OS X operating systems, we provide a fully configured `VirtualBox <http://www.virtualbox.org>`_ disk image to ease your building woes."

"This application records gestures and attempts to match them. You should "
"see a black drawing surface with some buttons across the bottom. As you "
"make a gesture on the drawing surface, the gesture will be added to the "
"history and a match will be attempted. If you go to the history tab, name"
" the gesture, and add it to the database, then simliar gestures in the "
"future will be recognized. You can load and save databases of gestures in"
" .kg files."

"This demonstration code spans many files, with this being the primary "

"managed in the file :ref:`historymanager.py "
"<demo_multistroke_historymanager.py>` and described in the file "
":ref:`historymanager.kv <demo_multistroke_historymanager.kv>`. The "
"database pane and storage is managed in the file :ref:`gestureDatabase.py"
" <demo_multistroke_gestureDatabase.py>` and the described in the file "
":ref:`gestureDatabase.kv <demo_multistroke_gestureDatabase.kv>`. The "
"general logic of the sliders and buttons are in the file "

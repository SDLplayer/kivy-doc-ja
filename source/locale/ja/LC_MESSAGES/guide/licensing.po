msgid "Your code alone may not require including licensing info and copyright notices of other used software, but binaries are something else. When a binary (.exe, .app, .apk, ...) is created it includes Kivy, its dependencies and other packages that your application uses. Some of them are licensed in a way they require including a copyright notice somewhere in your app (or more). Before distributing any of the binaries, please **check all the created files** that don't belong to your source (.dll, .pyd, .so, ...) and include approperiate copyright notices if required by the license the files belong to. This way you may satisfy licensing requirements of the Kivy deps."
